                            <p>Due to the growing expansion of worldwide markets, transfer pricing is becoming an increasingly relevant and significant feature for organizations throughout the world. We believe that transfer pricing should be viewed as an extension of a business rather than merely a compliance activity.
                                We offer an unbiased and unequivocal viewpoint on all aspects of compliance, planning and
                                implementation of Transfer pricing (TP) policy & implications of existing and proposed
                                transactions. In transfer pricing.</p>
                            <p>The transfer pricing methodologies that could be used to examine the arm's-lengthprice of controlled transactions are discussed in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommendations. The price that is imposed, offered, or charged when unrelated parties engage in similar transactions in an uncontrolled situation is referred to as an arm's-length pricing (ALP). </p>
                            
                            <h5>● Advance Pricing Agreements</h5>
                            <p>The Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is an agreement signed between the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) with the Taxpayer, determining the arm’s length price or specifying the manner in which the arm’s length price is to be determined, in relation to an international transaction. Such agreement shall be binding on the taxpayer and on the Principal Commissioner/Commissioner, and the income-tax authorities subordinate to him, in respect of the said person and the said transaction. We also assist our clients in preparing, executing and implementation of APAs.</p>
                            <p>International taxation has a lot of Litigations as a lot of interpretational issues arise during the course of transactions. We provide Assistance in obtaining advance rulings and no objection certificates from the Indian Income-tax Department, assistance in preparing and submitting legal submissions before the Income-tax authorities, including appellate authorities.</p>
                            
                            <h5>● Expat Taxation planning and Advisory Services</h5>
                            <p>Normally, a foreign citizen who visits India and renders services incurs tax liability on the income earned in India. When an expatriate works in India, their entire salary-related income is subject to tax, even if it is paid outside India.</p>
