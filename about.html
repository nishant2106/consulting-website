                                The transaction-based pricing model is based on the quantum of work. The client is
                                charged on the basis of the number of transactions with a price-per-transaction based on
                                the band of volume.

                                and there is no consistency of volume.

                            <h5>How to Outsource Your Accounts? </h5>
                            <p>Here is a stepwise methodology for outsourcing your accounts to Acco Global.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Step 1: Document Requisition </b><br>
                                We create a checklist of papers that our Client would be needed to provide for the
                                accounting function. The client must adhere to the checklist and provide all relevant
                                documents.
                                <br><b>Step 2: Document Handling Physical Documents </b> <br />
                                Tangible invoices and all other physical paper that we would receive from client are
                                included in these papers. We may hire someone to simply file the documents and scan them
                                all into a folder. We would also receive the scanned papers via File Transfer Protocol
                                Online Documents: Many papers would be sent via the internet, such as bank statements
                                and bills received via email. <br>
                                <b>Step 3: Document Processing </b> <br/> in India we would sort the documents in relevant folders and
                                have a naming convention for the documents in order to easily identify the documents. <br>
                                <b>Step 4: Data Entry of Documents </b> <br> The documents would be entered into QuickBooks, Xero,
                                Zoho or any other agreed ERP. We can store the scanned copy of the source document along
                                with the entry to make it easily accessible and it leaves an audit trail for the entry. <br>
                                <b>Step 5: Review of Entries </b> <br> All the entries would be cross checked and reviewed with the
                                source documents. <br>
                                <b>Step 6: Review of Accounts </b> <br> We would personally review all the information and have a
                                look at the entries in case any of them appears to be of abnormal nature. <br>
                                <b>Step 7: Reporting </b> <br> We can have following reports for the clients and mail them in order
                                to help them appreciate where their business is performing. Reports such as Ageing
                                analysis, MIS reports, analysis of accounts, Profit and Loss and balance sheet can be
                                provided on a monthly or quarterly or yearly as required by client. <br>
                                <b>Step 8: Finalization </b> <br> We would receive list of queries from Client or their tax
                                consultant. We would resolve each of the queries and get back with complete work. View
                                our checklist on finalization.
