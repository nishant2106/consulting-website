                            transactions is known as bookkeeping.<br/>Bookkeeping Service Include:

                        <h3>Why Outsource the Bookkeeping Process?</h3>
                        <p>When it comes to accurate accounting management, tracking accounts receivables and payables
                            along with maintenance of financial books, it is an essential but difficult task. It&#39;s difficult to
                            manage such items without the help of a support team that specializes in Bookkeeping Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>With increased competition to establish a startup or maintain an existing business, an organized
                            system for accounting, bookkeeping, and keeping track of the numbers is a must, and qualified
                            professional help from specialists is certain to come in handy.</p>

                            highly skilled personnel without having to invest in them or purchase and maintain high-cost
                            software.</p>
                        <p>Consider delegation of bookkeeping activity to an outsourcing firm if you have a small team that
                            handles the bookkeeping. This will allow you to focus more time on growing your business.
                            Furthermore, if you&#39;re a larger company, it can save you the time required to hire, train, and
                            manage an in-house accounting team.</p>

                        <h4>1.  Accounts Payable</h4>
                        <p><b>What is accounts Payable</b></p>
                        <p>"Accounts payable" (AP) is a general ledger account that shows an organization's obligation to repay a
                            short-term debt to creditors or suppliers. Another typical meaning of "AP" is the business department or division in charge of making payments to suppliers and other creditors on behalf of the company. </p>

                            <li>Supplier master Management</li>
                            <li>Purchase Order Processing</li>
                            <li>Invoice Processing</li>
                            <li>Payable tracking & Reporting</li>
                            <li>Vendor Payments</li>
                            <li>Reconciliations and Accounting of Payables</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>2.  Accounts Receivables</h4>
                        <p>Accounts receivable (A/R) is the term used to describe all of your unpaid invoices. It's an important part of your company's jigsaw. The term "accounts receivable collections process" refers to the process of
                            classifying invoices and collecting payment for them. </p>
                        <p>Acco Global shall enable the organization to collect quick receipts within the required time frame, resulting in higher collection rates and faster invoice processing, resulting in increased cash flow. It also helps in
                            taking timely actions if a receipt is getting prolonged for a longer period of time.</p>
                        <ol class="ol-group">
                            <li>Customer master Management</li>

                        </ol>
                        <h4>3.  General Accounting </h4>
                        <p>Record to report (R2R) is a finance and accounting management process that involves collecting, processing and presenting accurate financial data. R2R provides strategic, financial and operational feedback on the
                            performance of the organization to inform management and other stakeholders.</p>
                        <ul class="ul-group">
                            <li><b>Journals –  </b> Processing manual journal entries is a service that necessitates both knowledge and experience. Outsourcing accounting services such as manual journal entries could result in error-free manual journal entries as well as help your business managers be more productive. Journals could be of various types for eg., Prepayment and Amortization of Expenses, Reclassification of Expenses, Depreciation, Accruals and Provisions for various Expenses.</li>
                            <li><b>Month/Quarter/Year end Services -</b>An accounting method used by accountants to close
                                the accounting records for the current accounting period at the conclusion of each reporting
                                period. When a period is marked as closed, no new entries will be accepted during that time. It
                                assures that all financial transactions from the closed period have been accounted for. At each
                                reporting period being a month/quarter/year end Patience, knowledge, and professional
                                experience are required. The period closure process is a time-consuming process that requires
                                you to collect, evaluate, reconcile, and change data from multiple systems. The process&#39;s
                                complexity stems in part from the necessity for coordination across several functions in order to
                                perform their tasks on time.</li>
                            <li><b>Reconciliations –  </b>Each month/Quarter/six monthly/year, when the bank statement/statement of
                                inventory/creditor/debtor arrives, reconciliation should be done. It helps in the evaluation of
                                revenue and expenses, as well as the reconciliation of what the other party has recorded with
                                what you have documented.
                            <b>Following are major areas where reconciliation is required:</b>
                            <ol class="ol-group">
                                <li>Creditors Provide Inventory (Creditors to Inventory)</li>
                                <li>Inventory is sold to Debtors (Inventory to Debtors)</li>
                                <li>Debtors make payments against sales (Debtors to Cash &amp; Bank)</li>
                                <li>Cash and Bank is used to pay Creditors against purchases (Cash & Bank to Creditors)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                            <li><b>Variance Analysis –  </b> Most businesses today keep track of their finances with a budget. The
                                monthly closing procedure includes tracking monthly expenses against budget and explaining
                                notable variances. To obtain an accurate picture of the company's financial situation, a
                                comparison of actual to budget should be made. Variance analysis can aid in the correction of
                                errors and the posting of appropriate adjustments to prepaid and accrued charges. Variance
                                Analysis can be done for Year to Date, Quarter to Date, Month to date and Year on Year.</li>
                            <li><b>Reporting and Review –  </b> After completing the above functions, it is important to have a reporting mechanism for a
                                panoramic view for the financial status of an organization. Reporting of the transactions plays a crucial role as it helps not only organization but also other stakeholders such as investors,
                                auditors, government, shareholders, etc to evaluate an organization. Once reporting is
                                completed, it is very important to have a review of the financial status and other aspects so that necessary measures (if any) for future periods.</li>
