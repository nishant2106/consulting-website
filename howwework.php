                    <img src="img/process-methodology.png" alt="image"/>
                    <!-- <h5>How to Outsource Your Accounts? </h5>
                    <p>Here is a stepwise methodology for outsourcing your accounts to Acco Global.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Step 1: Document Requisition </b><br>
                        We create a checklist of papers that our Client would be needed to provide for the
                        accounting function. The client must adhere to the checklist and provide all relevant
                        documents.
                        <br><b>Step 2: Document Handling Physical Documents </b> <br />
                        Tangible invoices and all other physical paper that we would receive from client are
                        included in these papers. We may hire someone to simply file the documents and scan them
                        all into a folder. We would also receive the scanned papers via File Transfer Protocol
                        Online Documents: Many papers would be sent via the internet, such as bank statements
                        and bills received via email. <br>
                        <b>Step 3: Document Processing </b> <br /> in India we would sort the documents in relevant
                        folders and
                        have a naming convention for the documents in order to easily identify the documents. <br>
                        <b>Step 4: Data Entry of Documents </b> <br> The documents would be entered into QuickBooks,
                        Xero,
                        Zoho or any other agreed ERP. We can store the scanned copy of the source document along
                        with the entry to make it easily accessible and it leaves an audit trail for the entry. <br>
                        <b>Step 5: Review of Entries </b> <br> All the entries would be cross checked and reviewed with
                        the
                        source documents. <br>
                        <b>Step 6: Review of Accounts </b> <br> We would personally review all the information and have
                        a
                        look at the entries in case any of them appears to be of abnormal nature. <br>
                        <b>Step 7: Reporting </b> <br> We can have following reports for the clients and mail them in
                        order
                        to help them appreciate where their business is performing. Reports such as Ageing
                        analysis, MIS reports, analysis of accounts, Profit and Loss and balance sheet can be
                        provided on a monthly or quarterly or yearly as required by client. <br>
                        <b>Step 8: Finalization </b> <br> We would receive list of queries from Client or their tax
                        consultant. We would resolve each of the queries and get back with complete work. View
                        our checklist on finalization.
